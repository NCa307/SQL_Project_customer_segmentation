# MySQL Bank Customer Segmentation Project

## Data Description

This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India for the year 2016. The data contains customer information such as - customer ID, year of birth, location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction date, transaction date, transaction time and transaction amount.

## üìä Project Overview
This project analyzes banking transaction data to segment customers based on their behavior, transaction patterns, and value using SQL. The goal is to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing, customer retention, and service optimization.

## üîç Insights to be Explored

### 1. Customer Count By City
- Identifying Key Markets

### 2. Average Account Balance by City
- Identifying wealthier regions on average

### 3. Total Deposits Held by Location
- Sum of Account Balances per City 

### 4. Average Transaction Amount per Location
- Cities with higher average transaction amounts might be good targets for premium credit cards, personal loan campaigns etc.
  
### 5. Transaction Activity Level per Location (Transaction Frequency)

### 6. Total Transaction Volume per Location
-Which cities drive the most economic activity theough the bank? For example mega cities with large population sizes such as Mumbai will typically have higher volume even if each customer doesn't spend that much.

### 7. Peak Transaction Hours (number of transactions) per Location

### 8. Peak Transaction Months (number of transactions) per Location

### 9. Weekday vs. Weekend Activity (number of transactions)

## üìà RFM Analysis Framework: Segmenting customers based on their transaction behaviour.
### Recency: How recently did a customer transact? (Most recent transaction date)
### Frequency: How often do they transact? (Count of transactions)
### Monetary Value: How much do they spend? (Total amount transacted)

### 1. **Recency (R)**
Indicates an active relationship vs. a dormant account.
- **R=5 (Recent)**: Active relationship - active transactions (e.g., a customer who transferred money yesterday)
- **R=1 (Old)**: Dormant account - might be saving-only or about to churn (e.g. no transaction activity in 6 months)

### 2. **Frequency (F)**
How often does the customer conduct transactions?
- **F=5 (High-frequency)**: The customer depends heavily on the bank for daily transactions
- **F=1 (Low frequency)**: Occasional user (e.g., quarterly transactions only)

### 3. **Monetary (M)**
How valuable is the customer in terms of account balance and transaction amounts?
- **M=5**: High account balance, large transaction volume
- **M=1**: Low amount of transactions, low account balance
### RFM Segments **
-**1. Power Users
-**2. Salary Accounts
-**3. Dormant Savers
-**4. Transaction Heavy
-**5. Churn Risks
