MySQL Bank Customer Segmentation Project
Insights to be explored:
-Identifying transaction behaviour per customer:
Grouping customers according to the frequency and volume of transactions per month
-During which months do we have the highest amount and volume of transactions?
-Time based segmentation: At which times during the days do we see the highest number of transactions?
-Monetary Value Segmentation based on the volume of transactions (sum and average) per customer group.

-RFM Analysis:
1. Recency: Indicates an active relationship vs. a dormant account
Recent(R=5): Active relationship-active transactions (exp. a customer who transferred money yesterday)
Old(R=1): Dormant account-might be only saving or about to churn. (no transaction activity in 6 months)
2. Frequency: How often does the customer conduct transactions?
High-frequency(F=5): The customer depends on the bank strongly for her daily transactions
Low frequency(F=1): Occasional user. For example quarterly transactions only.
3. How valuable is the customer in terms of account balance and transaction amounts?
M=5: High account balance, large transation volume
M=1: Low amount of transactions, Low account balance

RFM Segments:
-Recent, Frequent, High-amount transaction and account balance customers: Power Users
